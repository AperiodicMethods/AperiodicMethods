# Aperiodic Methods Notebooks

Welcome to the Aperiodic Methods notebooks!

The notebooks in this project are organized as follows:

## 0) Overview & Background

This section covers an overview and the background for the project.

#### 00-Overview

A general overview of the project, and a list of methods.

#### 01-LiteratureSearch

An examination of the prevalence of these methods in the literature.

#### 02-Simulations

Introduces the simulations used throughout the project.

#### 03-Outline

Outlines the project with some examples.

## 1) Method Evaluations

This section evaluates individual methods, on simulated data.

#### 10-Methods

This notebook introduces how the method evaluation simulations are done.

#### 11-SpectralFitting

This notebook examines methods that fit aperiodic components to power spectra.

#### 12-SpecParam

This notebook examines the spectral parameterization ('specparam') method for parameterizing periodic and aperiodic components from neural power spectra.

#### 13-IRASA

This notebook examines the 'irregular resampling auto-spectral analysis' (IRASA) method for decomposing time series.

#### 14-AutoCorrelation

This notebook examines auto-correlation measures.

#### 15-Fluctuations

This notebook examines 'fluctuation' analyses, including the Hurst exponent, and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA).

#### 16-FractalDimension

This notebook examines fractal dimension measures that can be applied to time series.

#### 17-Complexity

This notebook examines complexity measures that can be applied to time series.

#### 18-Information

This notebook examines information theory measures, including entropy measures.

#### 19-MultiscaleEntropy

This notebook examines multiscale entropy measures.

## 2) Method Comparisons

This section compares between the different methods, on simulated data.

#### 20-MethodComparisons

This notebook introduces how the method comparison simulations are done.

#### 21-ExponentComparisons

This notebook compares methods that can be used to measure the aperiodic exponent, including specparam and IRASA.

#### 22-TimeDomainComparisons

This notebook compares between methods that operate in the time domain, including the fluctuation, complexity, and information measures.

#### 22-ExponentvsTimeDomain

This notebook compares exponent estimation to methods that operate in the time domain, including the fluctuation, complexity, and information measures.

## 3) Empirical Comparisons

Comparisons of methods on empirical data.

#### 30-DataComparisons

This notebook introduces how the real data are analyzed.

#### 31-EEGData

This notebook introduces real data analysis by analyzing a sample of resting state EEG data.

#### 32-DevelopmentalEEGData

This notebook analyses a larger dataset of developmental EEG data.

#### 33-iEEGData

This notebook examines a dataset of iEEG data.
