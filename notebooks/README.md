# Aperiodic Methods Notebooks

Welcome to the Aperiodic Methods notebooks!

The notebooks in this project are organized as follows:

## 0) Overview & Background

This section covers an overview and the background for the project, and covers Figures 1 & 2 of the paper.

#### 00-Overview

A general introduction to and overview of the project

#### 01-Outline

An outline of the types of methods included in the project.

#### 02-LiteratureSearch

An examination of the prevalence of these methods in the literature.

#### 03-Simulations

Introduces the simulations used throughout the project.

#### 04-SimulationTests

An introduction and overview of how the method evaluation simulations are done.

## 1) Spectral Domain Methods

This section introduces spectral domain methods, evaluating and comparing them on simulated data, and covers Figure 3 of the paper.

#### 10-SpectralMethods

Words, words, words.

#### 11-SpectralFitting

This notebook examines methods that fit aperiodic components to power spectra.

#### 12-SpecParam

This notebook examines the spectral parameterization ('specparam') method for parameterizing periodic and aperiodic components from neural power spectra.

#### 13-IRASA

This notebook examines the 'irregular resampling auto-spectral analysis' (IRASA) method for decomposing time series.

#### 14-ExponentComparisons

This notebook compares methods that can be used to measure the aperiodic exponent, including specparam and IRASA.

This section introduces time domain methods, evaluating them on simulated data, and covers Figure 4 of the paper.

#### 20-TimeDomainMethods

Words, words, words.

#### 21-AutoCorrelation

This notebook examines auto-correlation measures.

#### 22-Fluctuations

This notebook examines 'fluctuation' analyses, including the Hurst exponent, and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA).

#### 23-FractalDimension

This notebook examines fractal dimension measures that can be applied to time series.

#### 24-Complexity

This notebook examines complexity measures that can be applied to time series.

#### 25-Entropy

## 3) Method Comparisons

This section compares between the different methods, comparing their results on simulated data, and covers Figure 5 of the paper.

#### 30-MethodComparisons

This notebook introduces how the method comparison simulations are done.

#### 31-WithinComparisons

This notebook compares methods within the different method types, comparing, for example, different complexity measures to each other.

#### 32-BetweenComparisons

This notebook compares methods across different methods types, including testing different types of time domain methods to each other, and comparing time domain methods to frequency domain methods.
