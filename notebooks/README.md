# Aperiodic Methods Notebooks

Welcome to the Aperiodic Methods notebooks!

The notebooks in this project are organized into the following topics:

## 0) Overview & Background

Overview and background of the project.

#### 00-Overview

A general overview of the project, and a list of methods.

#### 01-LiteratureSearch

An examination of the prevalence of these methods in the literature.

#### 02-Simulations

Introduces the simulations used throughout the project.

## 1) Methods Evaluations

Evaluations of individual methods.

#### 10-SpectralFitting

Methods that fit aperiodic components to power spectra.

#### 11-IRASA

The 'irregular resampling auto-spectral analysis' (IRASA) method for decomposing time series.

#### 12-AutoCorrelation

Words, words, words.

#### 13-Fluctuations

Fluctuation based analyses, including the Hurst exponent, and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA).

#### 14-Complexity

Complexity and fractal dimension measures that can be applied to time series.

#### 15-Information

Information theory measures, including entropy measures.

## 2)Methods Comparisons

Comparisons of methods on simulated data. [UPCOMING]

#### 20-SpectralComparisons

A comparison of methods that operate in the frequency domain.

#### 21-TimeSeriesComparisons

A comparison of methods that operate in the time domain.

## 3) Empirical Comparisons

Comparisons of methods on empirical data.  [UPCOMING]

#### 30-EEGData

A comparison of a subset of data on example EEG data.

#### 31-iEEGData

A comparison of a subset of data on example iEEG data.
