# SlopeFitOscs
Testing Slope Fitting approaches on synthetic PSDs, and applying these methods to EEG datasets.

## Data
- EEGDev Dataset
    - EEG Dataset across developmental ages: childhood -> adult
- EEGChi Dataset
    - Example EEG data from Chicago group (courtesy of Jorge Yanar)
- Synthetic PSD data
    - Generated using FOOF synthetic PSD functions

## Legend (Notesbooks)
- SlopeFittingOscs
    - Overview of the fitting methods, demonstrating them on real data
- DataOutline
    - Outline of EEGDev dataset
- DevData
    - Processing EEGDev dataset
- SynFits
    - Creating Synthetic PSD data, and testing slope fitting approaches on them

## Notes
- These notebooks use different versions of Python, because otherwise it would be too easy.
    - Notebooks running FOOF use py27
    - Notebooks running MNE use py36
